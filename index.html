  <!--
    What is git & github?
      Git: is a version control system that helps you track changes in your code, and it is free and open source
      GitHub is a web-based platform that allows you to host and share your code with others.
        (other platforms Similar to github: [gitLab,bitBucket]).
      github simplify using git.
      Note: you can use git without github.
      git has GUI.(it is prefered to use git in command line to develope yourself).

    why you must learn git?
      1. developers contribute to the same project.(no one has his own project).
      2. you can revert changes.
      3. you can see who made the changes.
      4. you can collaborate to fix issues.
      5. you can collaborate to create new features.
      6. you can solve conflicts.
      7. you can organize features.

    Words you will hear:
      - repository(repo): which is put the projects in it (each project must has it own repo).
      - branch: is a copy of the repo for updating the project then return it to the repo.
      - local repo: is the repo on your Device as PC.
      - remote repo: is the repo on the server or the github...etc.
      - commit: is a snapshot or checkPoint in your local repo that has not sent yet to the remote repo.
      - clone: add a copy from local or remote.(you can add copies from local to other location to compare or try somthing
        for example which better website: PHP pure or frameWork).
      - push: is sending the commit to the remote repo.
      - pull: is getting the commit from the remote repo to the local repo.
      - Pull Request: is a request to merge the branch to the main branch by telling other about changes.

    Important Note:
      - Create repository for every Project.
      - Create anew branch for every feature or enhancement.
      - no needd to connect to remote repo when working.
      - anyone can push and pull depend on permissions.


    create repo and clone it:
      1. sign up in github website.
      2. create a new repo by writing a repo name, describtion, you want it private or public, add README file, and click create repository.
        Note: README.md (md is a stand for markdown [search about it in wikipedia]).
        Note: to add heading in README file, you should put # before the script.
        3. clone the changes by copy the link of the repo from the github then go to the CMD and put it in a specific place in your device
          by writing the code (git clone TheLink).(Note: when you enter in it, you will see the README file and next to the directory(main -> master)).

    some git commands in cmd:
      add & reset & commit:
        git status: to know the status or what is missed or what is happening in the directory.
        git add fileName(in his full directory): to add the untracked files in the project.
          Note: you can add all the files by using * instead of directory.
        git reset head fileName: to reset the changes in the project. for example, you don't want a specific file.
        git commit -m "message": to commit the changes in the project and put in the local repo.

      push local changes to remote:
      git branch: to know all your branch in the project.
      git remote -v: to know all your remote in the project
      git push remoteName branchName: to push the changes in the local repo to the remote repo (it may reqest your account in github).
      Note: you can add comment on the team editions in github.
      Note: if the team add code or anything. it will show to a green color, and if the team remove code or anything, it will show to a red color.
    
    pull new changes from remote:
      Note: if you want to delete repo you will go to the project you want to: 1) delete then settings 2) then danger zone then
      3) delete this repo 4) then do the other proceses. 
      to create file from another account as someone from the team (or out of the team) in github do the following:
        1. it preferes to let the admin invite you to the team (cause you will always get access when you send changes).
          Note: to invite person you should: 1) go to the project you want the person to be invited 2) then settings.
          3) then collaborations. 4) then search to the person you want. 5) an invited Email will be sent (he must accept it to invite).
        2. go to the project in github.
        3. click on (add file - create new file) then click fork (if you are not from the team).
        4. add the file you want to be in the project and write what should be in it.
        5. click on (commit changes) then choose (create...pull request or commit directory....) then commit changes.
      this file will be in the remote repo; so we will take to the local repo by write (git pull remoteName) code in cmd.
      git pull remoteName: to pull (fetch and merge) the changes from the remote repo to the local repo.

    everything about git configuration:
      git config -l: give you all the configuration in the project as a list.
      git help config: give you all the configuration in the project in browser.
      git config --global user.name "your name": to set your name in the project.
      git config --global user.name: to get your name in the project.
      git config --global user.email "your email": to set your email in the project.
      git config --global user.email: to get your email in the project.
      git config --global --unset user.name/user.Email: to remove your name or your email in the project.
      git config --global --edit: it wiil open your editor configuration and set from it.
      touch: create new file.

    generate & test public key:
      public key: يتعرف على المستخدم وكلمة مروره ولا يسجلهم في كل مرة يدخل يعمل حدث في اي جهاز وهذا ياتي لاشخاص لديهم صلاحيات
      to create a public key do the following:
      1) write (ssh-keygen -t rsa -b NumberOfBits -C "Email") in cmd which is generate the key by a specific type of algorithim 
        and ssh-keygen is stand for Secure SHell Key Generator, -t is meaning a type of algorithim,
        rsa is a type algorithim(search about them ), -b is number of bits, -C is to add mail client.
      2) write (cat filePathOfId_rsa.pub): to give you the content of this file.(work for any file).
      3) copy the content of this file and paste it in the github account in settings - SSH and GPG keys - New SSH key - key.
      4) write a title of this key then press (Add SSH key) button.
      5) then do a test in cmd by writing (ssh -T git@github.com) then confirm your password.

    repo from existing project:
      git init: to initialize empty git repository in directory that we in.
      to add exist project do the following:
        1) go to the github and create new repo.
        2) copy the (git remote ....) regarding to what you are in (HTTPS or SSH) and paste it in cmd.
        3) copy the (git push ....) regarding to what you are in (HTTPS or SSH) and paste it in cmd.
      git push -u origin main: it is pull then push.

    pull request with examples:
      pull request is a request to merge a branch into another branch.
        note:- if you are from the team or not, you should create fork for the project then edit it then commit as it learned.
        note:- you can commit to the master directory or in new branch then merge this branch to the master.
      to create pull request do the following:
      1) go to the project you want to create pull request then to the pull requests list.
      2) click on (new pull request) button.
      3) choose the branch you want to merge into and the branch you want to merge from.
      4) click on (create pull request) button.
      5) write a title and description for the pull request then click on (create pull request).
      6) then click on (merge pull request) button from the admin when we go to pull requests then confirm merge.
    Note: you can delete the fork and create it again after finshing your pull request without any problem.

    everything about aliases:
      git config --global alias.aliasName command : to set alias for the command.
      git config --global alias.aliasName "more than one command" : to set alias for the commands with spaces.
      git config --global alias.aliasName: to get alias of command.
      git config --global --unset alias.aliasName: to remove alias of command.
        Note:- you can open your editor configuration (git config --global --edit) and set from it.
    Note: search in google "git alias list" to know aliases that is made.

    branching & merge:
      git branch: to list all branches.
      git branch branchName: to create new branch.
      git branch -m branchName: to rename branch.
      git checkout branchName: to switch to branch.
      git checkout -b branchName: to create new branch and switch to it.
      git branch -d branchName: to delete branch if there is no edition to merge.
      git branch -D branchName: to delete branch even if there is edition to merge.
      git merge branchName: to merge branch to current branch(it is prefered if it is the master branch).
        Note:- when you merge from the new branch to the origin it sends a pull request to github account.
    
    mastering stash part 1:
      git stash: to save files that we have not wanted to publish them to branch yet.
      git stash list: to list all stashes.
      git stash pop: to apply files in stash to current branch and delete the stash.
      
    mastering stash part 2:
      it creates one stash in each stash operation.
      git stash save "message": to save files with message.
      git stash apply: to apply stash to current branch.
      git stash pop stash@{Id}: to apply files in specific stash to current branch and delete the stash.
      git stash drop: to delete the last stash we created.
      git stash drop stash@{Id}: to delete specific stash.
      git stash show: to show files in the last stash we created.
      git stash show stash@{Id}: to show files in specific stash.
      git stash clear: to delete all stashes.
        Note: stash commands will take the last stash we created.

    restore and clean:
      git restore --staged fileName(or *): to restore files from staging area to untracked files.
      code fileName: to edit file in visual stedio code.
      git clean -n: to show the untracked files that will be removed.
      git clean -f: to remove the untracked files.

    resetting the head:
      reset: it is used to delete commit that you do not want.
      head: it is the pointer that highlights to the last commit we create.
        to know the head use (git log) command.
          Note: to quit from the log use the key(q).
        Note: to delete commit that is the head, you have to highlight the head into another commit.
        Note: each commit has its own hash in github or in (git log) command.
      git reset --soft theHashOfTheCommit: to delete commits but keep the changes and set the head into the hash that we wrote.
      git reset --hard theHashOfTheCommit: to delete commits without keeping the changes and set the head into the hash that we wrote.
      git push reomteName BranchName --force: to make force update to the remote repo and the branch.
        Note:- it deletes what is before the head that we wrote.

    ignoring files & directories:
      file that we added to the project and its job is ignoring files:
        .gitignore: it is a file that we can write the names of files or directories that we do not want to track them in the repo (make them hedden files).
          Note: we set what we do not need to launch in this file such as anything end with the extention .log (*.log).
          Note:- if there are exceptions, use the Tag (!) then the exception files or extentions or...etc.
          Note: if you want to add file in staging area but it is in .gitignore file use the following:
          git add -f fileName (which means force add).
      to know more details about git ignore search (git ignore patterns) in google.

    tag and release part 1:
      tag:- it used to share that you create a new version (tags and leleases) of the project.
      there are two type of tags which are:
        1- lightweight tag: it is a simple tag that we can use it to share the version of the project.
          it is like a pointer that highlights to the commit that we want to share.
          Note: it is not stored in the local repo, it is stored in the remote repo.
        2- annotated tag: it is a tag that we can add a message to it and it is stored in the local repo and the remote repo.
      git tag: to show tags that we have.
      git tag tagName: to create a new tag (it is prefered to use like v1.0, v1.1, v2.0,... etc).
      git push origin tagName: to push the version Tag to the remote repo.
      git tag -a tagName -m "message": to create a new annotated tag (with its own message).

    tag and release part 2:
      git tag -l "message": to show list of tags that have the message that we wrote.
      git tag -d tagName: to delete the tag that we created from local repo.
      git push origin --delete tagName: to delete the tag that we created from remote repo.
      to create a release for the tag that we have from github, do the following:
        1- go to the tag that you want to create a release for it.
        2- click on the tag that you want to create a release for it.
        3- click on the create release button.
        4- write the title and the description of the release.
        5- click on the publish release button.

        thank you. break a leg.
